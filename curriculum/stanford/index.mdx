### YouTube:

There are several YouTube channels about Stanford University. Here are the three channels that I know: _Stanford_, _Stanford University School of Engineering_ and _stanfordonline_. Each channel shares some course videos about computer science, as well as some other discplines. It's a bit confused and I'd sugguest subscribing all of these channels.
