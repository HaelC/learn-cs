      <h3>Courses</h3>
      <p>
        Here is the link of computer science courses at Stanford University.

      <h3>YouTube</h3>
      <p>
        There are several YouTube channels about Stanford University. Here are
        the three channels that I know: <em>Stanford</em>,{" "}
        <em>Stanford University School of Engineering</em> and{" "}
        <em>stanfordonline</em>. Each channel shares some course videos about
        computer science, as well as some other discplines. It's a bit confusing
        and I'd sugguest subscribing all of these channels.
