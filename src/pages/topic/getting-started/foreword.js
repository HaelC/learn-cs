      <p>
        Welcome to Learn CS and welcome to the fancy world of computer science!
        There might be various reasons to learn computer science: write tools to
        handle the repetitious tasks to make your life easier; develop websites
        and applications that might potentially have millions of users; or maybe
        just want to become a software engineer and earn a lot of money.
        Whatever the reason is, it's never to late to get started.
      </p>

        However, there are so many resources online, even here at Learn CS site.
        You may just wonder, "where should I start?". Fortunately, here you can
        find the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Personally</em>, I would divide the process into four stages:{" "}
        <a href="#programming-language">Programming Language</a>, Data Structure
        and Algorithm, System and Application, and Infinity Possibilities. These
        stages are not strictly sequential, and you will go back and forth
        during your learning process. But now let's go through these stages in
        order.
